# Contributing guide

We're glad for your interest in our projects and taking the time to contribute ðŸ§¡

We created a set of rules and hints to make this process as easy and transparent as possible.

## Creating Issue and Pull Request

Submitting changes requires an issue to describe what you want to change and why. Secondly you will need to start a new pull request where your progress is tracked and all discussions related to your implementation is kept.
1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/upsidelab/spree_gladly)
2. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/upsidelab/spree_gladly/fork)
3. [Open a pull request](https://github.com/upsidelab/spree_gladly/compare)

### Naming convention

Make sure your commits as well as a title of the pull request match the repository convention.

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (**if applied, this commit will <...>**)
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
